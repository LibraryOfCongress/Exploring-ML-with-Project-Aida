dl --- an image generator for viewing the results of le and be

written by Motoi Iwata and Koichi Kise (Osaka Pref. Univ.)

1. FILES

  The archive dl-<date>.tgz, where <date> is the dete of production
of this archive, contains the program for drawing the line segments
and points extracted by "le" and "be".

2. Installation

  This program requires {\tt libtiff}.
In the directory you extracted the files from the archive,
just do {\tt make}. You can find {\tt dl} in the 
current directory if the compilation is successful.

  We have tested this program under RedHat 5.2 (kernel ver. 2.0.36)
with gcc 2.7.2.3.

3. Use

  The program {\tt dl} requires three arguments:
an input binary image (with sunraster or TIFF format), 
a file of line segments or points (the output of le or be),
and an output image (with TIFF format).
  These arguments are fed to the program as follows:

	dl -i <input image> -l <line segment file> -o <output image>
	dl -i <input image> -p <point file> -o <output image>

The description of optional argumenets can be found in
the memo of this software.

The Driver home was exceptionally pretty with a wealth of lavendar asters and goldenglow, the flowers being arranged throughout every room in a most artistic manner. Ferns and potted plants vied with the cut flowers in beauty and were also placed most effectively in the parlors and dining room. The affair of last evening celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of the wedding of Mr. and Mrs. Driver, who were married in London, England, August 16, 1858 and who shortly afterward came to this state to help in its upbuilding. Both Mr. and Mrs. Driver have been very active in the growth and advancement of the state and especially the city of Ogden where Mr. Driver conducted his business for many years and assisted in various ways in the upbuilding of the community. Last evening the family of Mr. and Mrs. Driver were present and assisted in receiving the guests and entertaining. The time was pleasantly spent and temptingly prepared refreshments were perfectly served during the entire evening. Mr. and Mrs. Driver were congratulated time and again on their wonderful agility and were extended happy wishes for many more anniversaries.","category":"Photograph"}},{"id":"5d308d44ca9e6f0001001477","location":{"standard":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/ndnp-jpeg-surrogates/uuml_contador_ver01/data/sn85058259/00237285621/1918061401/0645.jpg"},"region":{"toolName":"rectangleTool","color":"#fe0000","x":228.05329434653834,"y":894.536456345875,"width":1426.3119022803448,"height":1373.5651377547126,"label":"Illustration/Photo"},"width":5052,"height":7150,"meta_data":{"set_key":"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85058259/1918-06-14/ed-1/seq-5/","subject_url":"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85058259/1918-06-14/ed-1/seq-5/","subject_description":"Iron County record.

J. P Cronin, pastor of St. Patrick's church and Vicar General of the diocese, sank peacefully into the sleep that knows no earthly waking to take its flight to the bosom of her Saviour whom she loved and so faithfully served throughout her life. Suffering a fall thirteen months ago and in declining health thereafter, her death was not unexpected. Throughout her illness Mrs. Cronin never complained, but bore her sufferings with a most humble resignation to God's holy will and complete trust in the ever Sacred Heart, in which those of the true faith find comfort and support. She was born in Ireland and on May 6, 1858, was married to James Cronin in Churchtown, County Cork, coming at once to Kentucky and locating at Frankfort in 1859, but for the past forty-five years they have lived at Lexington. To their union were born nine children, of whom four are living, and whose devotion to their mother was beautiful, nursing and caring for her as any mother would her babe. She was truly a model Christian wife and mother and endeared herself to everyone. Last May Mr. and Mrs. Cronin celebrated their golden wedding, having with them their four living children, Rev. James P. and John Cronin, of Louisville, and Michael J. Cronin and Mrs. J. W. Lawrence, of Lexington. The funeral services were held Monday morning at St. Peter's church, Rev. Father Cronin being the celebrant of the solemn requiem high mass. A very touching eulogy telling of the virtues and beautiful qualities characteristic of the departed, was spoken by Rev. Father Punch, the pastor. The remains were laid to rest in the Catholic cemetery. For the bereaved husband and children the Kentucky Irish American feels deepest sympathy.","category":"Photograph"}},{"id":"5d26069caa800200010011b1","location":{"standard":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/ndnp-jpeg-surrogates/kyu_dubnium_ver01/data/sn86069496/00280763251/1918031301/0089.jpg"},"region":{"toolName":"rectangleTool","color":"#fe0000","x":2026.0950950402387,"y":2537.106393986864,"width":818.3061355574093,"height":1525.8372256794241,"label":"Illustration/Photo"},"width":5528,"height":7770,"meta_data":{"set_key":"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86069496/1918-03-13/ed-1/seq-2/","subject_url":"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86069496/1918-03-13/ed-1/seq-2/","subject_description":"The Adair County news.

He died Tuesday evening after a short illness and the funeral took place from All Saints' church there Thursday morning. For years Mr. Dunigan was prominent in local political circles, serving as a member of the General Council and as Superintendent of the Street Cleaning Department. After retiring from political life he was in business at Seventh and St. Catherine streets, and had many warm friends in the Dominican parish, who held him in high esteem for his many generous qualities. Besides his wife, Mrs. Margaret Dunigan, and one daughter, Miss Marian Dunigan, he is survived by two sisters, Mrs. Mary Crowe and Mrs. Charles Bent, both of Bridgeport, Conn., and one brother, Joseph Dunigan, who is connected with the local Postal Telegraph Company.","category":"Photograph"}},{"id":"5cdc883707638f000100016b","location":{"standard":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/ndnp-jpeg-surrogates/kyu_aluminum_ver01/data/sn86069180/00211104089/1918081701/0676.jpg"},"region":{"toolName":"rectangleTool","color":"#fe0000","x":2440.5333041772687,"y":1170.348898310732,"width":702.2086513994909,"height":1934.658322675816,"label":"Illustration/Photo"},"width":5632,"height":7381,"meta_data":{"set_key":"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86069180/1918-08-17/ed-1/seq-3/","subject_url":"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86069180/1918-08-17/ed-1/seq-3/","subject_description":"Kentucky Irish American.

Fonnesbeck\nMarthinus J. Fonnesbeck was born on his father's farm in Gjeller up, near Herring Denmark, April 20, 1841. As a boy and in early youth he worked as a farm laborer and at the age of eighteen was gaged as a traveling salesman of knitted goods, which occupation he followed until he was 24 years of age, when he was drafted into the Danish Army where he served for two years.\nAfter leaving the army he began business as a wholesale and retail dealer and manufacturer of knitted goods, in Copenhagen, where he worked up a very large business for that time.\nIn 1892 he closed out his business and set sail for America, and he arrived in Logan with his family in July of that year. Shortly after arriving here he homesteaded a quarter section of dry land near Weston Idaho, on which he located with his family. After a long struggle he succeeded in transforming a desert-like tract of land into a fruitful farm. After ten years he left his farm in charge of two of his sons, and then moved to Logan, where in company with two other sons began the manufacture and sale of knitted goods and established the solid business firm known as the Fonnesbeck Knitting Works.\nMr. Fonnesbeck was a keen student of history and modern politics, and was proud of the fact that he was one of the earliest exponents of the Social Democratic principles in Denmark.\nThe deceased leaves a wife, four sons, three daughters and twenty-three grand children to mourn his loss.","category":"Illustration"}},{"id":"5c4f9dbbd6342b0001004acb","location":{"standard":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/ndnp-jpeg-surrogates/uuml_julich_ver01/data/sn85058396/print/1918031101/0873.jpg"},"region":{"toolName":"rectangleTool","color":"#fe0000","x":1297.5223543294271,"y":1019.6407058174782,"width":2731.2,"height":2828.289100660386,"label":"Illustration/Photo"},"width":6828,"height":9206,"meta_data":{"set_key":"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85058396/1918-03-11/ed-1/seq-8/","subject_url":"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85058396/1918-03-11/ed-1/seq-8/","subject_description":"The Ogden standard.

For, after all, from a modish point of view the \"have beens\" of yesterday and the \"may bes\" of to-morrow are of but little importance if only the styles of today are of the type to make life interesting, even though war Is raging throughput the land.\nAnd that they most certainly are! So the pessimist who prophesied a dearth of beauty in the realm of summer dress is without honor in his own country, and no one is paying any heed to his calamatous croakings about the direful state of the autumn modes.\nFor if the poor old calamity howler made a mistake in the one instance he probably would in the other. And make a mistake he assuredly did, for never have clothes been more alluringly attractive than they are at present.\nOld Mother Nature believes in just enough variety to make us appreciate her perfections, but in midsummer she is particularly generous and gives to us of her very best. And to show that she appreciates her lavishness the August maid blossoms forth in apparel that matches the weather.\nNow is the time for the girl who is a lover of sheer raiment to indulge her fancy. What, for example, is more charming, and incidentally more \"comfy,\" for wear on warm afternoons than a pretty frock of organdie or of voile?\nDead white is trying to certain types, but a creamy tint is universally becoming.\nUnusually smart, but at the same time, delightfully simple, is the cream colored dress in which milady of the knitting needles looks so well.\nDeep bands of cream filet lace contribute that completesness of conception which always compels admiration, and the frock has attained a degree of ultra-perfection by the addition of a soft satin girdle and loop ends of old rose.\nA slipover blouse is a handy little garment to possess, and the one shown here is developed in turquoise blue in a silk and wool weave. Cream wool is employed to edge the novel little affair and also to fashion the corded girdle.\nThe more summery the day the more charming must be the hat that milady wears.\nFit for any fete is the wide brimmed chapeau cf white Milan, which is lightly veiled in blue Georgette, and carries a wealth of field flowers under a soft cloud of tulle.\nStreamers of palest lavender, pink and green in no wise from, but rather do they add to the beauty of the hat.\nIf we return to the busy knitter for a moment we notice that she has shown equally as good taste In the choice of her chapeau as of her frock.","creator":"UNDERWOOD \u0026 UNDERWOOD","category":"Illustration"}},{"id":"5bbf8a5bf5a52900010023d0","location":{"standard":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/ndnp-jpeg-surrogates/pst_davey_ver01/data/sn83045211/00237287654/1918022501/0529.jpg"},"region":{"toolName":"rectangleTool","color":"#fe0000","x":1395.4992104256123,"y":390.8585599487216,"width":2426.7684478371502,"height":1846.9140744829704,"label":"Illustration/Photo"},"width":5064,"height":6341,"meta_data":{"set_key":"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045211/1918-02-25/ed-1/seq-8/","subject_url":"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045211/1918-02-25/ed-1/seq-8/","subject_description":"Evening public ledger.

We will be here for a few days, then move to our permanent camp some where further inland. Last night I took a good shower bath and cleaned up a bit, so today I am feeling fine. At the present I am, at the Y. M. C. A.\n\"This morning I went to church and enjoyed the spirit of the meeting very much. \"Now dear mother, don't you worry about me. Uncle Sam is taking good care of us. He took all precautions available to land us safely and now it is up to each one to take care of himself.\n\"We have a splendid captain and he is doing his best to make everything as comfortable as possible for us. The few old men and women I saw yesterday seemed very glad to see us. No young men to be seen; they are all at the front. I will write again when we reach our camp.\n\"Now dear mother have Bro. Carl write for you and write often, as you know letters from home are a great comfort to a soldier. I will write to the boys and sister, in a few days, as soon as I get a little better acquainted around here.\n\"Trusting this finds you all well and happy as it leaves me enjoying the best of health and of good cheer.

The fire spread quickly along the docks and the Kerry Range, moored between two of the blazing piers, was fairly enveloped before she was released and drawn into midstream by fire boats.

Rosenscweig has been taken into custody as the final step in the petty persecution arising from factional differences in the \"Bloody Fifth\" Ward. Jerry is released from jail, his case is dropped and Strongburger \"broke\" - that is, requested to resign before being \"fired\" - as the result of the intervention of a family friend.\nWILLARD H. BUCKINGHAM, financial genius and the most powerful man in Philadelphia. At his nod political bosses as well as the underlings, move and, and move fast. When Buckingham's daughter,\nRUTH BUCKINGHAM, tells her father that Jerry is missing, the great man calls EDMUNDS an \"unofficial official,\" on the long-distance telephone at Atlantic City. Jerry's release is due to the effective work of Edmonds, Buckingham's \"push button.\" From\nMICHAEL KELLY, a Carey division leader, Jerry, while resting in the Lafayette Club before returning home, gets his first lesson in practical politics. He learns that the \"Organization's\" primary object is \"dealin' out jobs\" and that just so long as it performs its part of the pact with big business and turns over Republican majorities in all legislative and national elections it will not be interfered with locally.\nSYLVY AURESTSKY, a beautiful young Jewish girl, stops Jerry on the street as he is about to leave the club for his home and thanks him for his manly defense of the persecuted Rosensweig. When she leaves him, Jerry notices a sinister figure following the girl. Kelly informs him that the person is\nJOE MALDONO, a thug, pickpocket and gunman. As Sylvy is about to enter her home the Fifth Ward gangster stops her. When she refuses his invitation to attend a dance he threatens her and is about to employ force when Sylvy's father intervenes mildly. Maldono, piqued and revengeful, has Aurentsky arrested on the charge of receiving stolen goods. While this is going on Jerry and Ruth, safe in their Overbrook homes, have formed a \"Save-Philidelphia\" party with the watchword, \"For Sylvy Aurentsky.\" In a discussion with his father and brother just before this Jerry learns that\nJIM RAND, a Councils' lobbyist, has demanded $3000 to put a franchise for a spur track across Howard street through the municipal legislative body in forty-eight hours. For weeks Councils have refused to act upon the Archer's application, and Government is seriously tied up.","category":"Illustration"}},{"id":"59f8b6672ef33000010025e9","location":{"standard":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/ndnp-jpeg-surrogates/uuml_julich_ver01/data/sn85058396/print/1918102201/0239.jpg"},"region":{"toolName":"rectangleTool","color":"#fe0000","x":2930.876366544025,"y":5941.889382875308,"width":2557.0150537747727,"height":2810.713966506186,"label":"Illustration/Photo"},"width":6496,"height":9057,"meta_data":{"set_key":"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85058396/1918-10-22/ed-1/seq-4/","subject_url":"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85058396/1918-10-22/ed-1/seq-4/","subject_description":"The Ogden standard.

The skirt consists of four panels starting only at the hip and exposing the white chiffon foundation up to the waist line at the sides, as well as at the spaces between the green panels. The crush girdle is of the same green satin, as is also the small pointed bib-effect which emerges just above the girdle. The blouse is made of white chiffon matching the foundation of the skirt and is simply made with a deep laydown collar. There are leg-o'-mutton sleeves with deep cuffs, which are finished off by white chiffon frills, drooping over the hand.\nThere are three ornaments fashioned of green and white beads which adorn the vest. The two small ornaments are suspended by a triangular shaped piece from the lower edges of the bib, while the larger ornament hangs directly from the left side of the girdle and is finished off with ropes of beads. The costume is completed by a white long-handled parasol and a large sailor hat of broad-brim variety which is made of green satin-faced with double folds of white chiffon. There is a somewhat unique ornament on the hat in the shape of a key which pierces the crown. I call this my \"French Key to Victory!\" I wear with this costume white shoes and stockings.\nThis is my favorite afternoon gown because of the color, green, which in French is the color for \"hope,\" and because the costume is very plain while at the same time highly decorative.","category":"Illustration"}},{"id":"59c594502ef3300001000096","location":{"standard":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/ndnp-jpeg-surrogates/uuml_julich_ver01/data/sn85058396/print/1918011901/0225.jpg"},"region":{"toolName":"rectangleTool","color":"#fe0000","x":345.43668384351525,"y":8167.554593482786,"width":6028.658693062965,"height":511.0636709711125,"label":"Illustration/Photo"},"width":6464,"height":8915,"meta_data":{"set_key":"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85058396/1918-01-19/ed-1/seq-24/","subject_url":"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85058396/1918-01-19/ed-1/seq-24/","subject_description":"The Ogden standard.

They are also giving practical demonstrations of preserving processes and household economics. That the movement is a very popular one is shown by the crowds of women who gather around the special train at each stop and in their eagerness to gather information as to household economics. The theme of the demonstrations is that by modern scientific methods much food that was previously allowed to rot may be utilized by care and economy. The baggage car of this special train contains jars, cans and dehydrators and other equipment for demonstration work. A pamphlet entitled \"Hints to Housewives\" is scattered at every stopping place. The photographs herewith show the yonng women of the Food Conservation Battalion giving practical demonstrations in the preparation and conservation of foodstuffs.","category":"Photograph"}},{"id":"59e7048a2ef3300001001f09","location":{"standard":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/ndnp-jpeg-surrogates/uuml_indurain_ver01/data/sn85058396/print/1917080201/0339.jpg"},"region":{"toolName":"rectangleTool","color":"#fe0000","x":173.13831138632713,"y":925.7550074755476,"width":1758.2684617867544,"height":2264.436708932994,"label":"Illustration/Photo"},"width":6720,"height":9118,"meta_data":{"set_key":"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85058396/1917-08-02/ed-1/seq-2/","subject_url":"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85058396/1917-08-02/ed-1/seq-2/","subject_description":"The Ogden standard.

Of the sixteen bands of nation-wide reputation which entertained the great crowds during the Exposition season, Thaviu's was the only one requested for a return engagement. They had so successfully pleased the throngs during the opening days that the directors commissioned their return for the closing weeks.\nThe secret of Thaviu's popularity is not expressed so much in the size of his organization as in the unusual personnel and the fact that Thaviu is a master director of his accomplished musicians. All band music critics comment upon the sparkle, life and dashing brilliancy of his musical interpretation.\nTwo full concerts will be given on the fifth day of Chautauqua. In addition to the band in the evening, three grand opera singers from Thaviu's own grand opera organization will appear as soloists.","category":"Photograph"}},{"id":"59c19ad30545530001000245","location":{"standard":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/ndnp-jpeg-surrogates/uuml_julich_ver01/data/sn85058396/print/1918021601/0583.jpg"},"region":{"toolName":"rectangleTool","color":"#fe0000","x":3036.1470412242065,"y":279.2917285785042,"width":936.9786817094008,"height":2405.5126300148586,"label":"Illustration/Photo"},"width":6748,"height":9095,"meta_data":{"set_key":"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85058396/1918-02-16/ed-1/seq-7/","subject_url":"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85058396/1918-02-16/ed-1/seq-7/","subject_description":"The Ogden standard.
